Clustering is the task of gathering toghether items in a way that elements belonging
to the same group (the \emph{cluster}) are more similar to each other other than the ones
assigned to the other clusters.\\
More formally, the input is composed of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $X = \{x_0, \dots ,x_n\}$, the initial set of elements.
    \item $d: X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$, a \emph{metric} measuring the similarity.
\end{itemize}
The final goal is to find the cluster configuration
\begin{equation*}
    C = \left\{ C_0, \dots , C_m \right\}
\end{equation*}
partitioning $X$
into $m$ clusters solving the following multi-objective function:\\

$f\left(2^X\right) =$
\begin{math}
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{l}
            \text{minimize the intra-cluster distance}
            \\
            \text{maximize the inter-cluster distance}
        \end{array}
    \right.
\end{math}
