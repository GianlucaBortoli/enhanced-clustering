This work is a streaming, on-line and limited memory solution to the two most common
issues in the partitional clustering algorithms.
It has been tested against several datasets~\cite{ClusteringDatasets} with
very different characteristics in order to evaluate the overall performances that
can be achieved with this algorithm.
In addition, it provided promising results both in optimal and in several challenging
scenarios.

Moreover, a visual validation of the quality of the resulting clusters has
been performed in order to understand how this approach behaves under different
circumstances and to uncover its possible limitations.

Finally, this work discloses further optimizations that can be implemented to
improve the algorithm's performance both from the quantitative and the qualitative
points of view.
