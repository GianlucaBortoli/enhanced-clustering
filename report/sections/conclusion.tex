This streaming, on-line and limited memory solution to the two most common 
issues in the partitional clustering algorithms provided promising results.
It has been tested against several datasets~\cite{ClusteringDatasets} with 
very different characteristics in order to evaluate the overall performances that 
can be achieved with this algorithm.
Section~\ref{experiments} describes in detail some of the most important outcomes.

Moreover, a visual validation of the quality of the resulting clusters has 
been performed in order to understand how this approach behaves under different
circumstances and to uncover its possible limitations.

Finally, this work discloses further optimizations that can be implemented to
improve the algorithm's performance both from the quantitative and the qualitative
points of view.
