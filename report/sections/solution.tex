This work consists in solving the two main problems of "k-means"-like 
algorithms described in Section \ref{related} and \ref{problem_definition}:
choosing the $k$ parameter and placing the $k$ initial centroids.
The only assumption is that the dataset is generated from one or more gaussian
disitributions.


\subsection*{The choice of $k$}
The most common scenario does not involve a domain expert. In this way there is 
no prior knowledge that can be used to guess a proper and reasonable value for $k$.
The main idea behind the solution proposed in this work is that of exploiting density
analysis to get an initial estimate of the number of clusters in the data.

More formally, a \emph{peak detection} procedure is used to retrieve all the local
maxima in the density function for each feature\footnote{This is equivalent to finding 
all the local maxima in the density functions for each axis, if the item considered is
a point in an n-dimensional euclidean space.} of the items in the dataset. In this way,
a peak is defined as a data sample that is either larger than its two neighboring samples.
This results in a list of peaks for each feature space and finally a n-dimensional grid
matching every possible peack among all the features available is created.
In this way, the worst-case scenario is taken into account, allowing this approach not
to miss any potential centroid in the whole dataset\footnote{This approach produces an 
over-estimation of the real number of centroids, including also possible false-negatives.}.

Moreover, among all the potential peaks created, only those which have at least one data
item assigned after a run of the k-means are kept. This allows to discard all the 
false-positives that were found creating all the possible touples in all the feature spaces.
Furthermore, it represents the refinement step for the algorithm.

Finally, the number of items in this grid represents the value for the $k$ parameter.


\subsection*{Initial centroids bootstrap}
The other important phase is to find a good positioning of the $k$ initial centroids.



\subsection*{Applications}
The solutions presented in this work can have two main applications. On the one hand,
this procedure can be used as a bootstrapping phase for a  "k-means"-like algorithm. 
On the other, it can be integrated with other partitional clustering algorithms to
refine the local solution every certain number of iterations, allowing the system as a
whole to find increasingly better clusters.
