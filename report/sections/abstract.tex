Data mining, which is the process of extracting meaningful information from the data deluge we are 
facing today, is very important in the society and the industry nowadays.


Clustering techniques are essential in this growing field
and $k$-means is one of its most relevant representative; it is still widely used after more 
then 50 years after its invention.
The algorithm name itself reminds about its most notable weakness, namely the number of expected clusters 
($k$) must be know in advance. Furthermore, the quality of the result is very sensitive not only to this
parameter but also to the location of the initial centroids.


In this paper we propose DBB, an algorithm capable of
deterministically identifing a suitable value for $k$
as well as a proper set of bootstrap centroids.
This work consists in a refinement-based solution relaying only on the distribution
of the partial density function of the dataset (and then of each cluster).
Hence, it is applicable both in static contexts (as bootstrapping phase) and also in streaming scenarios,
where it is run every now and then to improve the $k$ estimation.
Even tough this idea is proposed as a $k$-means improvement,
it is not tied to it. DBB can be applied in any other partitional
clustering algorithm to refine the partial solution during the
computation phase.
