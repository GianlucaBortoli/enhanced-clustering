Data mining, the process of extracting meaningful information from a huge amount of data,
like from the data deluge we are living today,
is essential in the nowadays society and industry.
The clustering is essential in data mining
and the $k$-means is one of its most relevant representative: it is still widely used after more then 50 years from its invention.


The algorithm name itself reminds about its most notable weakness: the number of expected cluster, $k$, must be know in advance,
furthermore, the quality of the solution is very sensitive to it and to the selection of the actual initial centroids.


In this paper we propose DBB, an algorithm capable of
deterministically identify a suitable value for $k$
as well as a proper set of bootstrap centroid.
Give our technique to be a refinement based solution relaying only on the distribution
of the partial density function of the dataset (and then of each cluster)
it is applicable both in static, as bootstrapping phase, and in streaming contexts,
applied every now and then to improve the $k$ estimation.
Furthermore, event tough this idea is proposed as a $k$-means improvement,
its in no way bounded to it: DBB can be applied in other partitional
clustering algorithms to refine the local solution during the computation phase.
